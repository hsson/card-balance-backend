# card-balance-backend

The backend for the [Chalmers Card Balance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.creotec.chscardbalance2) application. It replaces the old closed-source implementation (which will become available when fully deprecated).

## Building
This implementation both supports Google AppEngine and native standalone runtimes. The API is implemented for Go v1.7+, with some fixes for Google AppEngine (which is currently running Go v1.6).

### Natively
To run the backend natively, simply run:
```
> go run main.go
```
And to build it:
```
> go build 
```

### Google AppEngine
To use Google AppEngine, first make sure you have the AppEngine SDK correctly installed. To start a test server, run:
```
> cd appengine
> dev_appserver.py app.yaml
```
And to deploy it to GoogleAppEngine:
```
> cd appengine
> gcloud app deploy -v <version> app.yaml
```
The backend is then available at `https://<version>-dot-<project-id>.appspot.com`.
